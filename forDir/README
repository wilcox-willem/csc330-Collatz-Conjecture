Language : Fortran

To compile, use the following commands
within the following subfolders

normal:
    compile ~ gfortran -o collatzNormal collatzNormal.f08
        num ~ collatzNormal num
    num-num ~ collatzNormal min max
recursive:
    compile ~ gfortran -o collatzRecursive collatzNormal.f08
        num ~ collatzRecursive num
    num-num ~ collatzRecursive min max

NOTES :: Fortran
    - What can I say? It's gross.
    - Yeah it can be fast, but I don't like it
    - It is kind of nice knowing like 90% of what's
      happening because it isn't as complex under the 
      hood (in comparison to some of the shenanigans in python)
      
    - I think I will only return to Fortran for the right price
      (who knows, I might change my mind on it and foam at the mouth
       if anyone dares tell me Fortran isn't the future)
