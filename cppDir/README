To compile, use the following commands
within the following subfolders

normal:
	  compile ~ c++ collatzNorm.cpp -o collatzNorm
	  run num ~ collatzNorm num
	run range ~ collatzNorm numMin numMax 

recursive:
	  compile ~ c++ collatzNorm.cpp -o collatzNorm
	  run num ~ collatzNorm num
	run range ~ collatzNorm numMin numMax

NOTES:

	For input, anything above 2.1 billion will not run
	Any input below 2 will also have a 0 sequence result

	I used uint64_t as my data type, but some of my peers
	mentioned unsigned long long is a good one too. As far
	as I am aware, they are both unsigned 64 bit ints, so
	shouldn't make a
